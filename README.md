# GitHub Action for deploying to Azure Container Instances

[GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions) gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. 

You can automate your workflows to deploy to [Azure Container Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/) using GitHub Actions.

Get started today with a [free Azure account](https://azure.com/free/open-source)!

This repository contains [GitHub Action for Deploying to Azure Container Instances](/action.yml) to deploy to Azure Container Instances. It supports deploying your container image to an Azure Container Instance.

The definition of this GitHub Action is in [action.yml](/action.yml).

# End-to-End Sample Workflows

## Dependencies on other GitHub Actions
* [Azure Login](https://github.com/Azure/login) Login with your Azure Credentials for Authentication. Once login is done, the next set of Azure Actions in the workflow can re-use the same session within the job.

## Azure Service Principal for RBAC
For using any credentials like Azure Service Principal in your workflow, add them as [secrets](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-enivronments-for-github-actions#creating-and-using-secrets-encrypted-variables) in the GitHub Repository and then refer them in the workflow.
1. Download Azure CLI from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest), run `az login` to login with your Azure Credentials.
2. Run Azure CLI command to create an [Azure Service Principal for RBAC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview):
```bash

    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor \
                             --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group} \
                             --sdk-auth
    
    # Replace {subscription-id}, {resource-group} with the subscription, resource group details of the WebApp
    # The command should output a JSON object similar to this:

  {
    "clientId": "<GUID>",
    "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
    "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
    "tenantId": "<GUID>",
    (...)
  }
```
  * You can further scope down the Azure Credentials to the Web App using scope attribute. For example, 
  ```
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "myApp" --role contributor \
                            --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.Web/sites/{app-name} \
                            --sdk-auth

  # Replace {subscription-id}, {resource-group}, and {app-name} with the names of your subscription, resource group, and Azure Web App.
  ```
3. Paste the json response from above Azure CLI to your GitHub Repository > Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret > **AZURE_CREDENTIALS**
4. Now in the workflow file in your branch: `.github/workflows/workflow.yml` replace the secret in Azure login action with your secret (Refer to the example below)

## Build and Deploy a Node.JS App to Azure Container Instances

```yaml

on: [push]
name: Linux_Container_Workflow

jobs:
    build-and-deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
        # checkout the repo
        - name: 'Checkout GitHub Action'
          uses: actions/checkout@master
          
        - name: 'Login via Azure CLI'
          uses: azure/login@v1
          with:
            creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
        
        - uses: azure/docker-login@v1
          with:
            login-server: contoso.azurecr.io
            username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
            password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        - run: |
            docker build . -t contoso.azurecr.io/nodejssampleapp:${{ github.sha }}
            docker push contoso.azurecr.io/nodejssampleapp:${{ github.sha }}

        - name: 'Deploy to Azure Container Instances'
          uses: 'azure/aci-deploy@v1'
          with:
            resource-group: contoso
            dns-name-label: url-for-container
            image: contoso.azurecr.io/nodejssampleapp:${{ github.sha }}
            registry-username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
            registry-password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
            name: contoso-container
            location: 'west us'
```

## Example YAML Snippets

### Deploying a Container from a public registry

```yaml
- uses: Azure/aci-deploy@v1
  with:
    resource-group: contoso
    dns-name-label: url-for-container
    image: nginx
    name: contoso-container
    location: 'east us'
```

### Deploying a Container with Volumes (from Azure File Share or GitHub Repositories)
```yaml
- uses: Azure/aci-deploy@v1
  with:
    resource-group: contoso
    dns-name-label: url-for-container
    image: nginx
    name: contoso-container
    azure-file-volume-share-name: shareName
    azure-file-volume-account-name: accountName
    azure-file-volume-account-key: ${{ secrets.AZURE_FILE_VOLUME_KEY }}
    azure-file-volume-mount-path: /mnt/volume1
    location: 'east us'
```

### Deploying a Container with Environment Variables and Command Line

**NOTE**: The values of ```secure-environment-variables``` will not be shown in the properties of the Azure Container Instance, but **will** be shown in the logs of the GitHub Action unless you specify them as Secrets.

```yaml
- uses: Azure/aci-deploy@v1
  with:
    resource-group: contoso
    dns-name-label: url-for-container
    image: nginx
    name: contoso-container
    command-line: /bin/bash a.sh
    environment-variables: key1=value1 key2=value2
    secure-environment-variables: key1=${{ secrets.ENV_VAL1 }} key2=${{ secrets.ENV_VAL2 }}
    location: 'east us'
```

# Local Development and Testing

If you wish to develop and test changes against a local fork or development repo, you can do so by including the `node_modules` in tagged release branch. Note that the `aci-deploy` repository does not include these modules in the master branch, so you cannot point your action to `aci-deploy/master` to pick up recent commits. 

Testing can be performed against your local repo by performing the following:

* Fork this repo.
* Create a separate branch on your local copy. This will be used to execute the action from your workflow.
* Perform an `npm install` and `npm run build`
* Ensure that you check in the `node_modules` directory to your branch.
* Update your workflow to refer to your tagged release from forked copy.
